# Screen Color Picker

**Displays the RGB, HSL and Hex values of the pixel color under your mouse pointer.**
* As you move the mouse, this program will show the color values in `RGB`, `HSL`, and `Hexadecimal` of the pixel under your mouse pointer.
* If you press `F10`, the displayed color will be locked allowing you to move the mouse freely without the displayed color changing.
* Press `F10` again to unlock the displayed color and return to normal behavior: displaying the color of the pixel under your mouse pointer.
